## Portuguese Opening - Wikipedia

The Portuguese Opening is a chess opening that begins with the moves: . 1. e4 e5 2. Bb5. The Portuguese is an uncommon opening. In contrast to the Ruy Lopez (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5), by delaying Nf3, White leaves the f-pawn free to move and retains the possibility of playing f2-f4. The trade-off is that White's lack of pressure on e5 leaves Black with a freer hand.
